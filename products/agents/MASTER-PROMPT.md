# Agentes — MASTER-PROMPT

> Authoritative development guide for the `agents` product.
> Plan and milestones: `project-history/roadmaps/julia-agents-academia-2026-09.md`.

## Purpose

Home of the NoctusAI managed AI agents. An agent works **on** another product through that
product's scoped API and never touches its database. Two agents in this release:

- **Julia** runs here, on the Claude Agent SDK in headless mode. She is reachable only from
  this app's UI. Her job is helping with the Academia de Reciclagem project, which she does
  by reading the `academia-de-reciclagem` API and proposing writes to it. A person approves
  or denies every write before it happens.
- **One Chat** runs inside `social-wiring` (WhatsApp) and stays there. This product lists it
  and switches its auto-reply on/off through a scoped social-wiring endpoint.

**Status (2026-09-14):** scaffold only. Every domain item below is PLANNED.

## Architecture (planned)

### Backend

```
products/agents/backend/app/
  main.py            → create_product_app("Agentes", "agents", settings)
  runtime/           → AgentRuntime Protocol · ClaudeAgentSdkRuntime · FakeAgentRuntime · make_agent_runtime()
  gate/              → approval gate: tool classification, pending approvals, timeout = deny,
                       single-use signed approval assertions sent to the target product
  agents/julia/      → spec.yaml · JULIA.md · plugin/skills/ar-* (baked, read-only, CODEOWNERS-guarded)
  tools/             → in-process SDK MCP tools that proxy HTTP to academia AFTER the gate
                       (the CLI subprocess never sees a product token)
  routers/           → conversations · messages · approvals · persona · agents (list, on/off)
  clients/           → academia API client · social-wiring toggle client (seed token scheme)
```

### Julia's hardened launch (non-negotiable)

- `setting_sources=[]`: no project `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json` or hooks get loaded.
- Explicit `allowed_tools`: the academia tool proxies, `WebSearch`, and `Skill` restricted to
  an explicit skill list.
- Explicit `disallowed_tools`: Bash, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit, Task, WebFetch,
  Read, Grep, Glob.
- `strict_mcp_config`, a minimal explicit `env`, and the CLI running under its own uid.
- Container: `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, read-only root filesystem, `--workers 1`.
  The approval wait lives in one process, and each approval row records `instance_id`.

### Database — schema `agents`

`agents` · `agent_personas` (versioned, one active per agent) · `conversations` (owner) ·
`messages` · `approvals` (`instance_id`). Every table has RLS; the tables are org-scoped via
`public.current_org_id()`.

### Frontend

The Agents UI (Julia chat, inline approvals, persona, agent list with toggles) consumes the
seed `ChatWindow` organ and `useRealtimeStream`. It adds no local chat components.

## What the framework provides automatically

- `/api/health`, `/api/team`, `/api/notificacoes`, `/api/llm/*`
- CORS, Sentry, exception handlers, middleware, rate limiting, logging
- Sidebar, Header, AppShell, page status filtering, SSO context, trial/license warnings

## Rules

- **No database access to another product.** Use its API with a scoped, expiring product token.
- **Every agent write goes through the approval gate.** An unanswered request is denied.
- **No client or company facts in this directory.** The repository is public; knowledge lives
  in academia's database.
- **Auth tests assert strictly `== 401`.** Owner checks return 404 on a foreign conversation.
- **Loading states:** `showSkeleton = isPending && !data`, `isRefreshing = isFetching && !!data`.

## Testing

```bash
cd products/agents/backend && pytest
cd products/agents/frontend && npx vite build
```

## Dependencies

- Backend: `noctusai_lib` + `noctusai_seed`; `claude-agent-sdk` (planned, M4)
- Frontend: `@noctusai/lib` + `@noctusai/seed`
